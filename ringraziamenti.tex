\emph{
 In my experience, people that live around us always contribute in some way in what we do. %Unless you are a hermit, of course. 
And there are different kinds of support people can give you, depending on your relation with them. 
On the affective side, I’d like to thank my family for always believing in me and in what I do, and supporting me in my choices.
I thank my girlfriend and my friends for their support and the priceless time I always spend with them. And my course mates, for all the time we studied together sharing knowledge and useful suggestions.
On the professional side, first of all I’d like to express my gratitude to my Supervisor and Professor Alberto Montresor for the passion he transmitted me during the course of Algorithms, for involving me in interesting projects and for supervisioning me during these last months.
I’d also like to thank my Erasmus Professor Erki Eassar for his skill in making me appreciate the course of Databases and for sharing me useful suggestions and essential material.
At last, I’d like to acknowledge my internship tutors in Tai, Andrea Carpineti and David Votino, for their technical and motivational suggestions about the project \textsc{MongoDB Performance}, and my colleague Bruno Graziano for his help in configuring and maintaining the system of virtual machines that hosted my clients and my Mongo cluster during the main tests. 
Have a good reading.
